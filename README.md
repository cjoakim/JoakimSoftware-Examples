This repo contains examples of using primarily Azure PaaS service
databases such as Cosmos DB NoSQL API, Cosmos DB Mongo vCore API,
and Azure PostgreSQL.  Also used are various Azure AI Services, 
Amazon S3 storage, and LLM orchestrators such as LangChain and
Semantic Kernel.

The examples are roughly functionally equivalent, as they use a
mainstream programming language (i.e. - C#, Java, Node.js/Typescript, and Python)
along with a web application framework typical of that language
ecosystem (i.e. - Blazor, SpringBoot, Express, and FastAPI, respectively).

These examples are both for my personal use, and for use on my
customer projects.  They are intended to be **starter projects**
rather than full-functionality business applications.
